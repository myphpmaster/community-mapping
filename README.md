# Coastal Malaysia at Risk: Mapping Climate Change's Impact on Vulnerable Communities.

## High-Level Summary
For this project, we developed an interactive layered map that visualizes the impacts of climate change on Malaysia’s coastal communities. The map integrates data on coastal erosion, rising sea levels, and flood patterns to highlight vulnerable areas at risk of environmental changes. By using open-source GIS tools and NASA datasets, the map provides a clear, data-driven understanding of how climate change is reshaping Malaysia’s coastlines. 

This project addresses the challenge by offering a spatial analysis of climate impacts on coastal regions, helping identify communities at risk. It also allows decision-makers to visualize these changes and explore targeted solutions such as protective infrastructure, sustainable land use, and nature-based approaches. 

The importance of this project lies in its potential to guide adaptation strategies, protect vulnerable communities, and promote sustainable development in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By making complex data accessible and actionable, the project empowers stakeholders to respond proactively to the growing challenges posed by climate change.

## Project Details

Our project, Coastal Malaysia at Risk, is an interactive layered map designed to visualize and analyze the impact of climate change on Malaysia's coastal communities. The map integrates data on coastal erosion, rising sea levels, and changing flood patterns, offering a comprehensive view of how these environmental challenges are evolving over time. By mapping these key issues, the project reveals the most vulnerable areas and identifies communities at risk of displacement and infrastructure loss.

### How It Works:
The project functions by using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to layer open-source spatial datasets on a digital map. The layers include:

* Current coastline and areas undergoing erosion
* Communities affected by rising sea levels and coastal flooding
* Historical flood patterns to visualize changes over time

These data layers are overlaid in a web-based, interactive format that allows users to explore specific areas, zoom in on communities, and see where climate impacts are most severe. Users can interact with the map to discover patterns, trends, and critical areas that require intervention.

### Benefits:
Data-Driven Insights: By visualizing climate data in a spatial format, this project helps policymakers, researchers, and local communities understand the immediate and long-term risks of climate change.
Informed Decision-Making: The map can be used as a tool for urban planners, environmentalists, and government bodies to prioritize adaptation strategies such as coastal protection, land-use planning, and community-based interventions.
Raising Awareness: The project educates the public about the effects of climate change on Malaysia's coastal regions and emphasizes the urgency of sustainable, proactive responses.

### Goals:
The primary goal is to identify the most at-risk coastal communities in Malaysia and provide a visual, data-driven tool to guide adaptation strategies. We hope this project will contribute to sustainable development planning, protect livelihoods, and support efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change along Malaysia’s coastline.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
* GIS Software: We used QGIS for building and analyzing the layered maps.
* Web Development Tools: The map was deployed using Leaflet.js, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
* Data Sources: Open-source datasets from NASA Earthdata GIS, NASA Worldview, NASA Environmental Justice Data Search Interface, the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS), as well as Malaysia-specific datasets such as the Flood Dataset (Malaysia), Public Infobanjir from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, and the National Coastal Risk Map together with Marine Data Repository, from National Water Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM).
* Coding Languages: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were used for creating the web interface, and Python was utilized for handling data manipulation.
* AstroWind: Utilized to streamline the front-end development of the interactive map, ensuring a fast and user-friendly web experience.
* GitHub: Used for version control and collaborative development, enabling seamless teamwork and project management.
* Visual Studio Code: Our primary code editor for writing and debugging the project’s code, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

### Use of Artificial Intelligence

No, we did not utilize any Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools or software in preparing this project. The project primarily focused on using Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies and open-source datasets to map and visualize climate change impacts on Malaysia's coastal communities. Our approach relied on data analysis, GIS software like QGIS, and web development tools for creating interactive visualizations, rather than AI-driven techniques.
